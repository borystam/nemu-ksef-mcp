"""Where invoices land, and why the file name is the whole invariant.

`WpisArchiwum` is the only aggregate, its identity is the KSeF number, and the
invariant — the same invoice is not stored twice — has no transaction to live
in. On a filesystem `rename(2)` inside one directory is the only atomic
primitive there is, so the invariant is enforced by writing `<KSeF number>.xml`
through a staging file and renaming it into place (D-006). Two runs carrying
the same invoice converge on one file because they derive the same name, not
because a set in memory told them to.

The name comes from `_metadata.json`, never from the entry name inside the
package and never from reading the invoice. A script that guessed from file
names reported ten and then seven missing invoices where four were missing;
the manifest carries the KSeF numbers, so it is the input to deduplication
rather than a substitute for it (D-005, #38).

Which document a KSeF number belongs to comes from the digest the manifest
states, not from a name it does not (GH-87). `_metadata.json` holds
`InvoiceMetadata` entries — the same model the metadata query returns — and
that model has no file-name field at all, so the first production package
refused itself. Pairing on `invoiceHash` is what the file name was reaching
for: derived from the bytes, it cannot point at the wrong document even when
the package names its entries however it likes.

Each subject gets its own subdirectory, per environment, because a shared one
is the main vector for mixing an accounting office's clients (D-032, D-034).
The deduplication index is a separate file from the invoices it describes, and
that separation is what lets the retention command delete invoice bodies
without the next synchronisation fetching every one of them again (D-034).
