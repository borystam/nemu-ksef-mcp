"""Recent period answers, reused briefly to conserve metadata queries.

The scarce resource is twenty metadata queries an hour, and the MCP server under
`uvx` is killed together with the agent session. Without a record on disk, the
second question about September is indistinguishable from the first and is paid
for twice — which is why D-021 rates this above deduplication: deduplication
saves disk, this saves the allowance.

Everything here lives under the platformdirs *cache* root, and that placement is
the load-bearing part (D-032). The cache convention reads "safe to delete at any
moment", and disk cleaners take it literally. So the two roots stay apart:

- cache root — this file, plus the marker of the last successful query. Losing
  it costs one re-query.
- data root — continuation points, the deduplication index, the archive. Losing
  those costs a full resynchronisation, and the symptom would surface long after
  the cleanup that caused it.

The same convention decides how a damaged entry is treated. `SyncStore` refuses
to guess at a record it cannot read, because a misread continuation point skips
invoices nothing asks for again. Here the honest answer to an unreadable entry
is to shrug and ask KSeF: the entry is reconstructible by definition, and one
query is exactly what its loss is supposed to cost.
