"""The permanent record of every read, because in a leak dispute it is the only one.

Compliance names one risk above the others: an agent fetches customer A's
invoices while answering a question about customer B. KSeF will never report
that as an error — the permission genuinely exists, the call is well formed, and
the API answers it. Nothing in the protocol distinguishes a read that was asked
for from a read that was not. What separates them is the record of who acted
under which NIP, on what footing, against which criteria, and which KSeF numbers
came back, and that record has to be written here or it does not exist.

Four kinds of event, kept apart on purpose (D-011). `DISK` says documents
landed in a file. `MODEL_CONTEXT` says metadata entered a tool's answer and the
model therefore saw it — "the chat was shown twelve" is a different event from
"twelve files were written", and folding them together loses exactly the
distinction D-011 draws. `DEDUPLICATION_SKIP` says an invoice was seen and
recognised as already held; a trail carrying only writes would read as though
that invoice had never been touched at all. `REMOVAL` says the bodies were
deleted by an explicit purge (D-034) — the one event where nobody saw anything,
and the one whose record has to survive the invoices it names.

The trail is written whether or not anything asked a human for permission. A
read needs no confirmation gate (D-011) and still needs a record: consent and
accountability are separate concerns and coupling them would delete the second
one the moment the first was decided against.

Numbers, never names, and never a body. A KSeF number identifies an invoice
completely for the purpose of reconstructing an access, and it says nothing
about the counterparty beyond a NIP already stated. Minimising personal data
inside the log is not decoration: the audit trail outlives retention of the
invoices it describes.

Appended, never rewritten — and that is a deliberate divergence from D-006. The
`temp → rename` pattern that guards `InvoiceArchive` and `ReviewStore` protects
a whole-file invariant: those files are read entire, and half a document reads
back as an empty one. A trail is the other shape. It only ever grows, nobody
edits its middle, and rewriting it whole on every append would both cost
quadratically over a server running for weeks and put the entire accumulated
record at risk to add one line. `fsync` follows every append, because evidence
that did not survive a power cut is not evidence.

`O_APPEND` places each write at the end of the file as it stands, and that is
all it does. A `write()` is indivisible against other appenders only up to
`PIPE_BUF`, so the claim that two processes acting for one subject cannot
interleave a line was true of short entries and false of a synchronisation
naming four subject types' invoices (GH-104). What actually serialises the
appenders is the subject's write lock (ADR-107 §5); `O_APPEND` remains because
the alternative to it is rewriting the whole trail on every line.
