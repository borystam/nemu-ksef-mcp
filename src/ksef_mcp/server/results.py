    The client of an MCP tool is a language model, and it has no way to guess

    absent from the fifth — which is what it was before (GH-171). Declaring the
    shared shape once makes the guess unnecessary, and makes a tool that forgets
    a field a type error rather than a surprise in somebody's prompt.

    `nip` and `environment` say whose books were read and against which
    registry. They were on four of the five answers; the synchronisation one
    left the reader to infer the subject from a directory path.

    `warnings` is a caveat about the answer, not a failure — a failure leaves
    through `reported()` and never reaches a result at all. A tool with nothing
    to caution about answers with an empty list, which is a different statement
    from having no such field.
