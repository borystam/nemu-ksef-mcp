"""Deleting invoice bodies without forgetting that they were ever held.

The archive does not expire on its own (D-034). That is a deliberate choice —
the local archive is the product's axis of value and what the Ministry expects
business operations to run against — and it was accepted on one condition: an
explicit command that frees the disk. Without it, a year later a laptop holds
every invoice of every subject an accounting office serves, contractors'
personal data included. This module is that safety valve, and it is part of
stage 1 rather than an addition to it.

What makes deleting safe is that the deduplication index is a separate file from
the invoices it describes (D-005). An `IndexEntry` outlives the body it was
written for, so after a purge the next synchronisation recognises those KSeF
numbers as already held and does not spend the twenty-exports-an-hour allowance
fetching them again. The index records an explicit removal decision before
deletion, so accidental loss can be repaired without undoing retention.

Three other files live beside the archive and none of them is touched either.
`synchronisation.json` records how far KSeF has been *asked*; resetting it would
force a full resynchronisation. `review.json` records what a person has already
*been shown*, and that stays true however long the body survives. `audit.jsonl`
is the record of accesses, and it outlives retention of the invoices it
describes on purpose — a purge appends to it rather than trimming it.

Both dimensions, combinable, because both cases are real and excluding either
would be a guess (D-034). Per subject: an accounting office loses a client and
must remove that client's data, which is one subdirectory (D-032) and never a
neighbour's. Per period: a one-person business cuts by tax year. Together:
"client X's invoices older than a year".

The period is read off the KSeF number itself, whose `<YYYYMMDD>` group states
the day the invoice reached KSeF. Opening an FA(2)/FA(3) body to learn a date
already spelled in its file name would mean reading a contractor's personal data
for nothing (D-011). A file whose name is not a KSeF number is reported and left
where it is: an irreversible operation does not get to guess.
