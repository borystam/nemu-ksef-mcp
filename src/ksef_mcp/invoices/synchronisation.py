"""Incremental synchronisation: package exports, high water mark, one subject type at a time.

The canonical pattern the Ministry publishes (D-031), not an invention of ours.
The window size, page size and number of packages are decided here or by KSeF.
The caller may select the historical starting point of a new synchronisation;
each subsequent pass remains bounded by the same windows and allowance.

The pass runs the whole way: a package KSeF reports as ready is fetched,
decrypted and written to the subject's archive inside the same call, and the
export key stops existing as part of that (ADR-104 §2, ADR-105). What survives
a failure is deliberate — the pending record with its key and its parts stays on
disk, and the continuation point stays where KSeF's own marker put it, because
the point tracks what the registry confirmed and not what this process managed
to write (ADR-103 §3).

# it is, so the list is the definition of "retry next pass", not of "give up".
#
# `PackageLinkExpired` is deliberately absent even though it is a
# `KsefPortError`: waiting is exactly what does not help it (GH-93). It is
