"""One month as one file, in the directory the taxpayer declared as theirs.

The chat window is where an answer is read; it is not where an answer goes.
A month reconciled in a conversation has to be re-typed to reach the place the
accountant's own work lives, and re-typing a hundred and thirty amounts is how a
grosz goes missing. So this module ends the month in a file that can be attached
to an e-mail, and the whole design follows from that file leaving the machine.

Leaving the machine decides the columns. The eight settled in #41 are the
reconciliation minimum — the KSeF number, the seller's own number, the date, the
counterparty's NIP and name, and the three amounts — with the currency added in
#63, because a month mixing euro and złoty otherwise summed into one figure that
meant nothing. Addresses, bank accounts and
invoice lines are absent by choice, not by omission: a CSV is the artefact most
likely to end up in somebody's cloud spreadsheet, so it carries what a
reconciliation needs and not one field more. Local paths are absent for a second
reason — they are useless to whoever opens the attachment, and the tool's own
answer already names them (D-011).

Leaving the machine also decides where the file lands. Neither the cache root
nor the data root: those are internal storage, and this is a product (D-032).
The working directory is the one the taxpayer named at onboarding, per subject,
`0700`, and a path that looks like a sync client's folder is called out rather
than silently used. A working directory inside either internal root is refused
outright — otherwise "deleting the statements does not touch the archive" is an
intention rather than a property.

The verification code is composed here rather than fetched. Its three parts —
the seller's NIP, the issue date, and the SHA-256 of the archived invoice — are
the same three the Ministry's verification path is built from, and the digest
comes from `archive.digest_of` over the file the archive actually holds, so the
code stands for the bytes on disk and not for a metadata row about them. It is
the code and not a portal address: a verification link is a bearer credential
(D-012), and this file is written to be forwarded.

    """The same caveat `currency_warning` makes, for the other way a sum misleads.

    A correcting document does not restate the invoice it corrects; it carries
    the difference. The Ministry's schema says as much at `P_15` — "w przypadku
    faktur korygujących: korekta kwoty wynikającej z faktury korygowanej" — and
    its `TKwotowy` pattern admits a leading minus, so the difference may be
    negative.

    Two sentences and not one, because the two positions call for different work
    (ADR-111). A correction whose original invoice is in the same window needs
    none: the difference and the amount it applies to are both inside, so the
    Brutto column adds up to the obligation by itself. A correction without it
    is the one that misleads, and no sum taken in this file can repair it —
    the answer is in the period the original invoice was issued in.

    Naming the count and the numbers, rather than the fact alone: the reader has
    to find the rows to do anything about it, and a warning that sends them
    through a hundred and thirty of them is a warning that gets ignored.
